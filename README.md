# Mumbai-House-Prices-Prediction

# Abstract
House price forecasting is an important topic of real estate. The literature attempts to
derive useful knowledge from historical data of property markets. Machine learning
techniques are applied to analyze historical property transactions in India to discover
useful models for house buyers and sellers. 

# Aim
Create an effective price prediction model
• Validate the model’s prediction accuracy
• Identify the important home price attributes which feed the model’s predictive power.

# Dataset
The dataset was used from Kaggle.com

# Methodology
The required libraries were loaded, the first step for any machine learning problem is to perfom Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The techniques involved feature imputation, feature engineering, feature selection, scaling, cleaning and handling of outliers. Dimensionality Reduction techniques were used to find the best suited features for the optimal performance of model. The algorithm - XGBRegrosser was used for the prediction of the dependant variable. It resulted in an accuracy of 83%.
